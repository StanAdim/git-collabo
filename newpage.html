        The South China Sea raid was cond
        ucted by the United States Third
         Fleet between 10 and 20 January 1945 
         during the Pacific War. Undertaken to
          support the liberation of Luzon in the Philippi
          nes, it targeted Japanese warships, supply convoys and air
          craft in the region. After attacking airfields and shipping
           at Formosa and Luzon, the Third Fleet entered the South China Se
           a and aircraft from its carriers attacked Japanese shipping off Frenc
           h Indochina on 12 January, sinking 44 vessels. The fleet then sailed north 
           and attacked Formosa again on 15 January. Further raids wer
           e conducted against Hong Kong, Canton and Hainan the next day. Th
           e South China Sea raid was highly successful as the American force de
           
           stroyed a large number of Japanese ships and aircraft, while losing 
           relatively few aircraft. According to historians, the destruction of c
           argo vessels and oil tankers was the most important result of the raid, as t
           hese contributed to closing a supply route which was vital to the Japanese war
